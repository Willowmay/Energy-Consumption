# Energy-Consumption


This project is one of my course mideterm project, cooperated with my classmates Adam Kirstein. Thanks to our team effort!

Dataset Description & Data Source

The dataset that we have chosen to use is an historical representation of consumed energy transition by country from 1800. 
The dataset is broken into columns of various energy sources, such as fuelwood, and electricity, 
and then shows each year what percentage of each energy source is used by each country. 

For example, in 1800, Canada was primarily using wood as a fuel source, accounting for 88% of its main source of energy. 
As time moves on, we can see that Canada's percentage use of Fuelwood decreases, and its percentage use of Coal increases. 

The energy transition data was published on the website Our World In Data, 
and boasts data collected by sources including the Joint Center for History and Economics, 
BP Statistical Review, The World Bank, and The International Renewable Energy Agency, amongst others. 

One method employed by The World Bank includes 
sourcing related data from the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) database from the SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework. 
All of the data were then compiled into a single dataset found at https://ourworldindata.org.
